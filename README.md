Trying to learning how to use gethub interfaces.
I got off the a slow start but it seems like I'm getting the hang of it now.
A little about myself. I'm a student at Long Beach City College trying to get an Associates Degree as a web developer, which is why I'm learning how to use github. When I run into problems I like to be able to collaborate with others who know or are learning PHP.
